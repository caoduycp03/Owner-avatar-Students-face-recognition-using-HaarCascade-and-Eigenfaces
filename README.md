# Owner avatar Students face recognition using HaarCascade and Eigenfaces

I use Haar Cascade for face detection and use PCA for bounding box image crop and use SVM to classify the faces of 5 members of my group based on previously collected data. 

With this project, you can capture, train and test with your own faces.
